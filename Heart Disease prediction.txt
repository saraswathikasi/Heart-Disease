Heart Disease prediction

This model is used for prediction of a person has heart disease or not it will classify the person having heart disease with 1 or 0

Here we have used the vecstack library which is used for advanced stacking of models(ensemble learning).

We have also imported some more library like pandas - data loading and handling, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs , scipy for scientific computations

Here Counter is used to Count unique values in data (like how many people have disease vs donâ€™t).

Here the line after splitting the data is using the random_state when it is assigned the splitting of the data is done each time when you run the code.

The word bias is used which means that (the model is giving importance to a feature)

Some features (columns) have very large numerical values, while others have small values, which can unfairly influence the model.

ðŸ“Š Example:
Letâ€™s say you have two features:

Age: ranges from 20 to 80

Cholesterol level: ranges from 100 to 300

Now imagine you feed them into a machine learning model without scaling:

Cholesterol numbers are much larger than age.

The model might "think" cholesterol is more important, just because the numbers are bigger â€” not because it really is.

This introduces bias in learning.

So here we use Standard Scaler which is used for scaling all features in the dataset such that they have  Mean = 0 or Standard deviation = 1 

This removes the bias caused by large or small values.

All features are on a similar scale, so the model treats them equally.
